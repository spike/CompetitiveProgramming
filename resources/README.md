### Programming Language Syntax

If you want to do well in Leetcode, you really need to master the standard syntax of your chosen programming language, and for that, I recommend you use spaced repetition. Knowing a language well is a prerequisite to Leetcode.

But please keep an open mind. I'm not saying you should memorize everything. You should definitely not memorize everything.  But if you catch yourself googling the same standard syntax over and over again, I think it may be worth memorizing and make it part of your muscle memory.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
If you're new to Data Structures and Algorithms, I recommend you get one of these two books. Either one should do. And technically, you don't need a book, because everything can be found online for free, but still, if you like to learn from dead tree books, get yourself one of these two:

Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/  (this book doesn't cover as much material as the second book below)

A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills

https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222/

### General Advice 

A good summary of what you need to learn:

Edbert Chan on Youtube. He has a "You suck at Coding Interviews" video series. Plus he has some live coaching sessions worth looking at. Personally, I like his idea of keeping a practice diary and video recording yourself when solving problems.

### Key Learning Strategies

The concept of "Deliberate Practice" from other disciplines/sports.

The concept of "Random Practice". Random practice is the best way you're going to train yourself at pattern recognition. This is why you should be doing our meetup homework, the daily Leetcode problems, and/or the Leetcode weekly contests.

### General Strategies for Problem Solving

Tips to be a better problem solver by 3Blue1Brown

I also have two books on problem solving, but this video does a pretty good job of summarizing what's in those books as well. 

### Leetcode Contests

I recommend you try to do the Leetcode contests. The time pressure helps. They're usually at 7:30 PM on Saturdays (Pacific Time).  

https://leetcode.com/contest/

I've started posted my own Leetcode contests on my youtube channel. Chances are, you can probably do better than I can in these contests.

### Advanced Topics

Here is a particularly good video by Errichto on youtube on the different nuances of Binary Search. Because even if you know Binary Search pretty well, it can be difficult to implement in different scenarios.

Abdul Bari, a Computer Science Professor, on Youtube. He has some of the clearest explanations of complicated algorithms. His materials are definitely not for beginners. Also, his videos are old and the sound is not great, but his explanations are so clear, they're worth listening to.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw

Elements of Programming In Java (they also have a version for Python and one for C++) https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517671272/ This book is definitely not for beginners, but if you need to up your Leetcode game, this book is the one to get. 

It contains a variety of difficult problems. It also has a test suite you can git clone and directly load into your IDE. You do not need to buy the book to download the test suite. https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/
