### Programming Language Syntax

In our meetup, we all use different programming languages, but if you don't know where to start, I'd suggest you start with [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) and do most the problems on this site: https://pypup.com/

If you want to do well in Leetcode, you really need to master the standard syntax of your chosen programming language, and for that, I recommend you use active recall and spaced repetition. Knowing a language well is a prerequisite to Leetcode.

But please keep an open mind. I'm not saying you should memorize everything. You should definitely not memorize everything.  But if you catch yourself googling the same standard syntax over and over again, I think it may be worth memorizing and make it part of your muscle memory. Basically, think of it like driving a car or riding a bicycle, the more you can rely on your muscle memory for low-level mechanical tasks (the ones you do most frequently), the less you'll need to interrupt your flow and the more you'll free up your brain to focus on more important things.

Recall vs. Recognition memory (5 min video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q6jgTIQIx8 (knowing the difference between Recall memory and Recognition memory is also very important!! I've seen dozens of people completely fail at using flashcards or at using spaced repetition software, precisely because they didn't understand the implications of this very concept! This video is less than 5 minutes. There is really no excuse not to watch it. Also, be sure to take the tests given.)

### Data Structures and Algorithms
If you're new to Data Structures and Algorithms, or if you need to review, I recommend you get one of these two books. Either one should do. And technically, you don't need a book, because everything can be found online for free, but still, if you prefer to learn from dead tree books, and don't already own one on DSAs, get yourself one of these two:

Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/  (this book doesn't cover as much material as the second book below)

A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills

https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222/

### Binary Search (or Bisection Search)

Invariant Binary Search by Code Badger (please use this particular competitive programming approach to Binary Searches)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhonEHz2raw **This is now my favorite Binary Search approach by far!**

Binary Search Leetcode Explore Card (95% of that explore card is available for free without a premium subscription). It includes a number of Leetcode problems you can practice on for each pattern. 
https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/

Video by Errichto on youtube on the different nuances of Binary Search. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU7DpgHINWQ

Bisection method lecture for finding square root. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzQFGOvH-mk Bisection search means the same as binary search. Personally, I like to find different approaches/videos/resources that explain the same topic(s). I recommend you do the same. I find it helps consolidate what I've learned. And sometimes, it helps me grasp a detail I might have missed.

### Other Advanced DSA Topics

Recursion for DSA/CP : BEST way to Understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UM_J1jE1dg

Abdul Bari, a Computer Science Professor, on Youtube. He has some of the clearest explanations of advanced algorithms. His materials are definitely not for beginners. Also, his videos are old and the sound is not great, but his explanations are so clear, they're worth listening to.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw

Elements of Programming In Java (they also have versions for Python and C++) https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517671272/ This book is definitely **NOT** for beginners, but if you like working on medium-hard and hard problems, this book is the one to get. It contains a good variety of difficult problems. It also has a test suite you can git clone and directly load into your IDE. You do not need to buy the book to download the test suite. https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/ And unlike "Cracking the Code Interview", the EPI book is much more reader-friendly, because it gives you the solution right after each problem, so you don't have to flip the book to the end each time you're looking for the official solution or the pattern. 

### General Strategies for Problem Solving

Tips to be a better problem solver by 3Blue1Brown

### Learning Strategies

The concepts of "Deliberate Practice" and self-reflection from other disciplines/sports is very useful for Leetcode
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=deliberate+practice

The concept of "Random Practice". Random practice is the best way you're going to train yourself at pattern recognition. This is why you should be doing our meetup homework, the daily Leetcode problems, and/or the Leetcode weekly contests.

"The Feynman Technique": 
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=feynman+technique+in-depth

"Incremental Reading" can be very useful for the harder materials that would normally put you to sleep otherwise:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNCLLNZEtz0

### Leetcode Contests

Once you've recently solved ~50 problems on your own, I'd recommend you try to do the weekly Leetcode contests. The time pressure helps. And the randomness of the problems will help with your pattern-recognition. They're either at 6:30PM or 7:30PM on Saturdays (Pacific Standard Time). If you're on a different time zone, they also have biweekly contests at 6:30AM or 7:30AM (PST but depending on daylight savings) every other Saturday morning.

I've started posting my own Leetcode contests on my youtube channel.

### Chrome extensions I use for Our Algorithms Meetup

Paint Tool - Marker for Chrome. This tool is useful to draw diagrams on the Leetcode page itself. 

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/paint-tool-marker-for-chr/nadohmjilefnhjobhhlnnddplaklmnnp

Leetcode explained Chrome Extension (similar as Video Solutions, but works with new Leetcode UI). The list of channels is curated, so it has many fewer videos than the Video Solutions extension. Also, it's adding some AI features for analyzing your code.

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leetcode-explained/cofoinjfjcpgcjiinjhcpomcjoalijbe

***Special Note:*** The two extensions below only work on the old legacy Leetcode design (and I'm not sure when they'll be updated to work with the new design). If you need to re-enable the old design, you need to right click your avatar from inside a problem's page and select "Go back to old design". Now the reason most people can't find this menu item is because it's context sensitive, this menu won't show up on the problems list page, it will only show up when you're on an actual problem's page. 

Leetcode Video Solutions - This Chrome extension overlays a tab with related youtube videos on top of each leetcode problem. You do not need Leetcode Premium to use this.

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leetcode-video-solutions/ilnmgkahgjdpkoliooildngldmilhelm


LeetHub - Automatically integrate your Leetcode submissions to GitHub (*please read my ***security warning*** below!!)
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi

***Security Warning:*** I do not know the author of this LeetHub extension. And this extension requires READ and WRITE access to ALL your public and private repositories on Github. Be aware of what you're doing. Only install this extension if you have nothing critically important on the Github account you're using, or set up a different Github account just for this extension.

### For Mock Interviews

I recommend you do the free peer-to-peer interviews on https://pramp.com 

They have good prepared problems, but they only have 36 problems. 

Also, you can use our [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bayareaalgorithms) discord server to find mock interview partners or study partners. 

### Running your tests locally

Here is good universal approach for generating your own tests quickly for Leetcode/CP problems.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/debugging-like-competitive-programmers/

Also if you follow one of the EPI books, they have a free test suite and stub code you can download from their site.
